They carry little to no marks and are meant to help students self-diagnose their learning to improve their software development skills and enhance their understanding of the concepts taught in class.  They are also meant to make students think deeper about the lessons, apply what they learn, and gain experience and confidence in their ability to develop complex software.  Despite the smaller weightage, we expect that students spend most of their time on formative assessments.</p> <p>The summative assessments, on the other hand, are meant to evaluate student learning.  These include three two written assessments (Test 1, Test 2 [previously called midterm] midterm and the final exam) as well as two practical exams.  These are high-stakes assessments carrying 90% of the total weights.</p> <p>The types of assessments include:</p> <ul> <li>Problem Sets: After every lecture (starting Week 3), we will provide some problems to make students reflect and practice applying what they have learned.  These questions are not graded.  There is no need to submit answers for grading.  They will be discussed and presented during the recitation sessions.  Some questions are marked as \"Homework\" intended as an introduction to the topic of the following week.</li> <li>Past Year Test Papers: Past year test papers are made available for practice.  These are not graded.  There is no need to submit answers for grading.  Selected questions may be discussed during class.  They can be discussed on Ed.</li> <li>Quizzes: The online quizzes are released every week after the lecture (i.e., Monday, 2 PM) and are due one day after lecture (Tuesday, 11:59 PM).  The quizzes are more tightly coupled to the content of the weekly lectures and are meant to help students self-diagnose their understanding of what is taught for that week.<ul> <li>You may attempt the quizzes an unlimited number of times.  We will consider only your highest score.</li> <li>We will release a \"Practice\" version on Wednesday for revision.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Programming Exercises: These are programming questions of various difficulty levels that are critical for students to solve, to gain experience, skills, and confidence in applying CS2030S concepts to programming.  Typically students spend more than half of their time in CS2030S on solving these programming exercises.  Students should submit them on time to get feedback from their lab tutors.</li> <li>Lab Exercises: These are \"mini\" practical assessments.  Questions follow closely with the topic of the current week and the previous week.  These are used to ensure that students continuous practice and are prepared for practical exams.<ul> <li>Lab exercises are done every 1-2 weeks during lab session.  They are timed and has to be finished within 45 minutes during the lab session.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Practical Exams: Students will be given programming questions to solve within a limited time frame (typically 1-2 hours), in an examination setting in SoC computer labs.  This is usually held in the evening or on a Saturday.</li> <li>Test 1, Midterm and Final Exams are written tests (on pen and paper) conducted in exam halls.</li> </ul> <p>All summative assessments (i.e., practical exams and written exams) are closed book assessments.</p>"},{"location":"about/info.html#assessment-weightage","title":"Assessment Weightage","text":"Component %% Dates Notes Self Diagnostic Quizzes 5% Weekly 0.5% per quiz ; 12 quizzes ; 15 questions per quiz ; we drop the bottom 2 quizzes from the mark Lab Exercises 5% Every 1-2 Weeks during lab session and timed ; 1% per exercise ; 7 exercises ; 2 tasks per exercise ; we drop the bottom 2 exercises from the mark Practical Exam 1 15% 11/10/2025 (tentative) on a Saturday ; in-person and timed (1 hour 30 minutes) Practical Exam 2 25% 08/11/2025 (tentative) on a Saturday ; in-person and timed (2 hours) Midterm 20% 29/09/2025 (tentative) during lecture period ; written assessment ; in-person and timed (1 hour) Final Exam 30% 26/11/2025 arranged by Office of University Registrar (OUR) ; please follow their instruction"},{"location":"about/info.html#marking-and-review","title":"Marking and Review","text":"<p>Mistakes in grading may occur and we try to minimize this issue as follows.</p> <ul> <li>We will provide a review of grading for summative assessments (e.g., tests, practicals, and finals) after the grade for each assessment has been released.

There are objective metrics with which one can measure the complexity of software, but here, we will loosely define complexity as anything that increases the likelihood of bugs in a program.</p> <p>Let's start by considering a simplified view of what a software program is.  One can view a software program as a collection of data variables and instructions on how to modify these variables.  A program is generally written to meet a given requirement: given one or more input variables, the program should perform the computation to produce the output variables, in a way that meets the requirement.  Often, the program stores information in the intermediate variables while performing the computation.</p> <p>As a student who has gone through an introductory programming course such as CS1010 and its variants, you should be familiar with the view above, and you should have some experience writing a program to solve a given computational problem.  The programs you have written for these introductory courses are mostly small \"toy\" programs \u2014 they consist of only a few hundred lines and tens of variables, at most.</p> <p>Software development in the real world, however, is far more complex than what you have experienced.  A software program rarely solves a well-defined computational problem only.  It often requires multiple components, such as user interface, data storage, and business rules, intricately interacting with each other to attain a set of functionalities.  </p> <p>As the requirement of the software becomes more complex, the number of variables that need to be kept track of increases; the logic of the computation the programmer needs to maintain the variables becomes more complicated.  Further, it is often that the variables are interdependent.  For instance, updating a variable might require updating another; how a variable should be updated might depend on another variable.  As the number of variables increases, so is the number of relationships between the variables that the programmer has to keep track of.  Failure to correctly maintain the variables and the relationship between them most likely will lead to bugs.</p> <p>Further, real-world software rarely remains static.  This property is again different from what you have experienced in your introductory programming course, where once the instructors release a programming assignment, they rarely go back and change the requirements.  In the real world, software evolves \u2014 new features are added, business rules change, and better algorithms are deployed.  The code needs to be updated accordingly \u2014 adding new variables and new computation; changing how variables are updated or are dependent on each other.  Updating the code of an already-complex software program to keep up with the requirement, if not managed properly, can lead to bugs.</p> <p>Real-world software is often the product of teamwork from multiple programmers, where the software development process is unlike what you have experienced in your introductory programming course, where you solve your homework individually.  When multiple programmers work together, the interdependency between the states needs to be communicated and handled properly and consistently across the programmers.  One programmer's modification to the code should not introduce bugs into another programmer's code.  </p> <p>Since software evolves, the notion of \"multiple programmers\" actually applies even to software developed by a single lone programmer across time.  Changing one's code should not introduce new bugs to other parts of the code that were written some time ago.  </p>"},{"location":"notes/00-overview.html#strategies-to-tame-complexity","title":"Strategies to Tame Complexity","text":""},{"location":"notes/00-overview.html#good-software-development-practices","title":"Good Software Development Practices","text":"<p>If you are taught properly in your introductory programming courses, you should already be familiar with good programming practices that help to tame the complexity and reduce the chances of bugs.

To prevent this, both the programming language system and the programmers, have to adhere to certain rules when extending or modifying the behavior of the existing code.  Java and many other typed languages have type systems \u2014 a set of rules that governs how variables, expressions, and functions interact with each other.

By utilizing the type system properly, we can detect potential bugs before they manifest themselves.</p> <p>A reason CS2030/S chooses to use Java is due to its type system.  CS2030/S will introduce the concept of types, subtypes, compile-time vs. run-time types, variants of types, parameterized types, and type inferences, in the context of Java.

For example, we can do the following:</p> JavascriptPython <pre><code>let i = 4;   // i is an integer\ni = \"5\";     // ok, i is now a string\n</code></pre> <pre><code>i = 4        // i is an integer\ni = \"5\"      // ok, i is now a string\n</code></pre> <p>Java, on the other hand, is a statically typed language.

Similarly, the compile-time type of the variable <code>i</code> is <code>int</code>.  <code>double</code> can hold a larger range of values than <code>int</code>, thus all values that can be represented by <code>i</code> can be represented by <code>d</code> (with possible loss of precision).  Using the terminology that you just learned, <code>double</code> is a supertype of <code>int</code>.</p> <p>On Line 3, the Java compiler allows the value stored inside <code>i</code> to be copied to <code>d</code>. The worst that could happen is that we lose a bit of precision.  On Line 4, however, we try to copy the value stored in <code>d</code> to <code>i</code>.  Since <code>d</code> is a <code>double</code>, it can store a value outside the range supported by <code>i</code> and can have order of magnitudes difference between them.  This would be a problem if the code is allowed to execute!</p> <p>This example shows how subtyping applies to type checking.  Java allows a variable of type \\(T\\) to hold a value from a variable of type \\(S\\) only if \\(S &lt;: T\\).  This step is called widening type conversion.  Such conversion can happen during assignment or parameter passing.</p> <p>Why is it Called Widening?</p> <p>The term widening is easy to see for primitive types.  You can immediately see that the subtype has narrower range of values than the supertype.</p> <p>The opposite conversion is called narrowing because the range of values is narrower.</p> <p>You may have noticed that, in the example above, the value of <code>d</code> is 5.0, so, we can store the value as 5 in <code>i</code>, without any loss.  Or, in Line 3, we already copied the value stored in <code>i</code> to <code>d</code>, and we are just copying it back to <code>i</code>?  Since the value in <code>d</code> now can be represented by <code>i</code>, what is wrong with copying it back?  Why doesn't the compiler allow Line 4 to proceed?</p> <p>The reason is that the compiler does not execute the code (which is when assigning 5.0 to d happens) and it (largely) looks at the code, statement-by-statement. Thus, the line <code>i = d</code> is considered independently from the earlier code shown in the example.  In practice, Line 4 might appear thousands of lines away from earlier lines, or may even be placed in a different source file.  The values stored in <code>d</code> might not be known until run time (e.g., it might be an input from the user).</p>"},{"location":"notes/02-type.html#additional-readings","title":"Additional Readings","text":"<ul> <li>Java Tutorial: Primitive Data Types and other Language Basics</li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/03-function.html","title":"Unit 3: Functions","text":"<p>Learning Objectives</p> <p>After this unit, students should</p> <ul> <li>understand the importance of function as a programming construct and how it helps to reduce complexity and mitigate bugs.</li> <li>be aware of two different roles a programmer can play: the implementer and the client.</li> <li>understand the concept of abstraction barrier as a wall between the client and the implementer, including in the context of a function.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/03-function.html#function-as-an-abstraction-over-computation","title":"Function as an Abstraction over Computation","text":"<p>Another important abstraction provided by a programming language is the function.

We can isolate the complexity within its body: the intermediate variables exist only as local variables that have no effect outside of the function.  A function only interacts with the rest of the code through its parameters and return value, and so, reduces the dependencies between variables to these well-defined interactions.  Such compartmentalization reduces the complexity of code.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>int factorial(int n) {\n  if (n == 0) {\n    return 1;\n  } else {\n    return n * factorial(n - 1);\n  }\n}\ndouble e(int n) { // approximate e^n using Taylor series\n  double x = 1;\n  double res = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n    res = res + (x/factorial(i));\n    x = x * n;\n  }\n  return res;\n}\n// The n in factorial is different from the n in e.\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Functions allow programmers to hide how a task is performed.  The caller of the function only needs to worry about what the function does.  By hiding the details of how, we gain two weapons against code complexity.  First, we reduce the amount of information that we need to communicate among programmers.  A fellow programmer only needs to read the documentation to understand what the parameters are for, and what the return values are.  There is no need for a fellow programmer to know about the intermediate variables or the internal computation used to implement the functions.  Second, as the design and requirements evolve, the implementation of a function may change.  But, as long as the parameters and the return value of a function remain the same, the caller of the function does not have to update the code accordingly.  Reducing the need to change as the software evolves reduces the chances of introducing bugs accordingly.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>double sinc(double x) {\n  return Math.sin(x)/x;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We do not need to know how to implement <code>sin(x)</code>, only whether <code>x</code> is in degree or radian.</p> </li> <li> <p>Functions allow us to reduce repetition in our code through code reuse.  If we have the same computation that we need to perform repeatedly on different values, we can construct these computations as functions by replacing the values with parameters, and pass in the values as arguments to the function.  This approach reduces the amount of boiler-plate code and has two major benefits in reducing code complexity and bugs.  First, it makes the code more succinct, and therefore easier to read and understand.  Second, it reduces the number of places in our code that we need to modify as the software evolves, and therefore, decreases the chance of introducing new bugs.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {\n    : // implementation omitted\n}\nboolean isEquilateral(double x1, double y1,\n    double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3) {\n  return distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) == distance(x2, y2, x3, y3)\n      &amp;&amp; distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) == distance(x1, y1, x3, y3);\n}\n// Define distance once, use it 4 times!\n// If we make a mistake in the function distance, we just have to correct it in one place\n//   instead of 4 different places if we did not use the function.\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>Returning More Than One Return Value?</p> <p>To return more than one value, we need to use a data type that can store multiple values.

The abstraction barrier separates the role of the programmer into two: (i) an implementer, who provides the implementation of the function, and (ii) a client, who uses the function to perform the task.

This is another powerful abstraction in programming languages that helps us to think at a higher conceptual level without worrying about the details.   Commonly used examples are mathematical objects such as complex numbers, 2D data points, multi-dimensional vectors, circles, etc, or everyday objects such as a person, a product, etc.</p> <p>Defining composite data type allows programmers to abstract away and be separated from the concern of how a complex data type is represented.</p> <p>For instance, a circle on a 2D plane can be represented by the center (i.e., <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) and its radius <code>r</code>, or it can be represented by the top left corner (i.e., <code>x</code>,<code>y</code>) and the width <code>w</code> of the bounding square.</p> <p>In C, we build a composite data type with <code>struct</code>.  For example,</p> A Circle using struct<pre><code>typedef struct {\n  double x, y; // (x,y) coordinate of the center.\n  double r;    // radius\n} circle;\n</code></pre> <p>Once we have the <code>struct</code> defined, we have a new data type called <code>circle</code>.  However, we are not completely shielded from its representation, until we write a set of functions that operates on the <code>circle</code> composite type.  For instance,</p> Functions that operates on Circle<pre><code>double circle_area(circle c) { ... };\nbool   circle_contains_point(circle c, double x, double y) { ... };\nbool   circle_overlaps(circle c1, circle c2) { ... };\n  :\n</code></pre> <p>Implementing these functions requires knowledge of how a circle is represented.  The implementation will be different if we have a different representation of <code>circle</code> (e.g., <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> may represent the center of the circle or the top left corner of the bounding square).  But once the set of functions that operates on and manipulates circles is available, we can use the circle type without worrying about the internal representation.  Of course, this assumes that we will only use the functions specifically written to work on circle type.</p> <p>Additionally, the example on <code>circle_overlap</code> highlights another advantage of having a composite data type.  To see the advantage, imagine that you do not have the data type <code>circle</code>.  Then the function to check if two circles overlap would require 6 parameters.</p> <pre><code>bool circle_overlaps(double x1, double y1, double r1,\n    double x2, double y2, double r2) { ... };\n  :\n</code></pre> <p>We have used a nice numbering to clearly indicate how the parameters are related.  Those with the same suffix belong to the same circle.  But another programmer may instead write it in a different order.</p> <pre><code>bool circle_overlaps(double x1, double x2,\n    double y1, double y2, double r1, double r2) { ... };\n  :\n</code></pre> <p>Even worse, lazy programmers may even omit the suffix and make the entire code unreadable.  So the use of composite data type is like a \"glue\" that binds relevant data together.  That way, we know that all the elements that make up a circle will always be together.</p> <p>If we decide to change the representation of a circle, then only the set of functions that operate on a circle type need to be changed, but not the code that uses circles to do other things.  In other words, the representation of the circle and the set of functions that operate on and manipulate circles, fall on the same side of the abstraction barrier.</p> <p>If you are the programmer who writes the code for the implementation of the circle as well as the functions that operate on and manipulate the circle then you are the implementer.

This result is due to both circles <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> sharing the same point.  When we pass the center into the constructor, we are passing the reference instead of passing a cloned copy of the center.  </p> <p>This is a common source of bugs and we will see how we can reduce the possibilities of such bugs later in this course, but let's first consider the following \"fix\" (that is still not ideal).</p> <p>Let's suppose that instead of moving <code>p</code>, we add a <code>moveTo</code> method to the <code>Circle</code> instead:</p> Circle v0.5.1 (with moveTo)<pre><code>class Circle {\n  private Point c;   // the center\n  private double r;  // the length of the radius\n    :\n\n  /**\n   * move the center of this circle to the given point\n   */\n  void moveTo(Point c) {\n    this.c = c;\n  }\n\n   :\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now, to move <code>c1</code>, <pre><code>Point p = new Point(0, 0);\nCircle c1 = new Circle(p, 1);\nCircle c2 = new Circle(p, 4);\nc1.moveTo(new Point(1, 1));\n</code></pre></p> <p>You will find that <code>c1</code> will now have a new center, but <code>c2</code>'s center remains at (0,0).

The operator returns <code>true</code> if <code>obj</code> has a run-time type that is a subtype of <code>Circle</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Field Access: To compare <code>this</code> circle with the given circle, we have to access the center <code>c</code> and radius <code>r</code>.

This is allowed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explicit Typecast: The statement that assigns <code>obj</code> to <code>circle</code> involves type casting.  We mentioned before that Java is strongly typed, so it is very strict about type conversion.  Here, Java allows type casting from type \\(T\\) to \\(S\\) if \\(S &lt;: T\\). <sup>3</sup>: This is called narrowing type conversion.  Unlike widening type conversion, which is always allowed and always correct, a narrowing type conversion requires explicit typecasting and validation during run-time.  If we do not ensure that <code>obj</code> has the correct run-time type, casting can lead to a run-time error (which if you recall, is bad).</p> </li> </ul> <p>All these complications would go away, however, if we define <code>Circle::equals</code> to take in a <code>Circle</code> as a parameter, like this:</p> Circle v0.7.2 (with Overloaded\u203d equals)<pre><code>class Circle {\n    :\n  /**\n   * Return true the object is the same circle (i.e., same center, same radius).\n   */\n  @Override\n  public boolean equals(Circle circle) {\n    return (circle.c.equals(this.c) &amp;&amp; circle.r == this.r);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This version of <code>equals</code>, however, does not override <code>Object::equals(Object)</code>.  Since we hinted to the compiler that we meant this to be an overriding method, using <code>@Override</code>, the compiler will give us an error.  This method is not treated as method overriding, since the method signature for <code>Circle::equals(Circle)</code> is different from <code>Object::equals(Object)</code>.</p> <p>Why then is overriding important?

To be more precise, when the method <code>equals</code> is invoked on the target <code>curr</code>, how does Java decide which method implementation is this invocation bound to?  While we have alluded to the fact that the run-time type of the target <code>curr</code> plays a role, this is not the entire story.

To determine the method descriptor, the compiler searches for all methods that can be correctly invoked on the given argument.</p> <p>In the example above, we look at the class <code>Object</code>, and there is only one method called <code>equals</code>.  The method can be correctly invoked with one argument of type <code>Object</code>.</p> <p>What if more than one methods can correctly accept the argument?  In this case, we choose the most specific one.  Intuitively, a method \\(M\\) is more specific than method \\(N\\) if the arguments to \\(M\\) can be passed to \\(N\\) without compilation error.  For example, let's say a class <code>Circle</code> implements:</p> <pre><code>boolean equals(Circle c) { .. }\n\n@Override\nboolean equals(Object c) { .. }\n</code></pre> <p>Then, <code>equals(Circle)</code> is more specific than <code>equals(Object)</code>.

Let's try to understand this using our definition of \"more specific\" above.</p> <p>Consider the second part of the definition, \"if the arguments to \\(M\\) can be passed to \\(N\\) without compilation error\".

The requirement given is that the system must be able to process a reservation during its opening hours between 1200 to 2200 (inclusive).</p> Example 2: Restaurant<pre><code>public class Restaurant {\n  public static final int OPENING_HOUR = 1200;\n  public static final int CLOSING_HOUR = 2200;\n\n  public boolean canMakeReservation(int time) {\n    if (time &lt;= CLOSING_HOUR &amp;&amp; time &gt;= OPENING_HOUR) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The method <code>canMakeReservation</code> returns <code>true</code> when the argument passed into <code>time</code> is between 12 PM and 10 PM. Let's think about how we would test this method.  Two important edge cases to test are to check if the method returns true for the stated restaurant opening and closing hours.</p> Test Cases<pre><code>Restaurant r = new Restaurant();\nr.canMakeReservation(1200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n  : // test for other hours between 1200 - 2200\nr.canMakeReservation(2200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n</code></pre> <p>Note that these are simple <code>jshell</code> tests, in software engineering courses you will learn better ways to design and formalize these tests.</p> <p>We can now rephrase our LSP in terms of testing.

These restaurants can take reservations at any time. We create a subclass <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code>, as follows:</p> Example 2: Digital Ready Restaurant<pre><code>public class DigitalReadyRestaurant extends Restaurant {\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean canMakeReservation(int time) {\n    return true;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Similarly, as <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code> \\(&lt;:\\) <code>Restaurant</code>, we can point our variable <code>r</code> to a new instance of <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code> and run the test cases of the parent class, as can be seen in the code below.</p> <pre><code>Restaurant r = new DigitalReadyRestaurant();\nr.canMakeReservation(1200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n  : // test for other hours between 1200 - 2200\nr.canMakeReservation(2200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n</code></pre> <p>Both test cases pass.

One of the statements executes <code>throw new E2();</code>, which causes the execution in <code>m4()</code> to stop. JVM now looks for the block of code that catches <code>E2</code>, going down the call stack, until it can find a place where the exception is handled. In this example, we suppose that none of <code>m1()</code>-<code>m4()</code> handles (i.e., <code>catch</code>) the exception. Thus, JVM then jumps to the code that handles <code>E2</code>. Finally, JVM executes the <code>finally</code> block.</p> <p>Note that the <code>finally</code> block is always executed even when <code>return</code> or <code>throw</code> is called in a catch block.</p> <p></p> <p>So the reason why the execution jumps from the call frame of <code>m4()</code> directly to the <code>catch(E2 e)</code> is because in between them there are no other <code>catch</code> blocks.

For instance, instantiating <code>Pair&lt;S,T&gt;</code> into <code>Pair&lt;String,Integer&gt;</code> causes a new type to be generated during run-time.  In C++ and in Rust, instantiating <code>Pair&lt;String,Integer&gt;</code> causes new code to be generated during compile-time.  This approach is sometimes called code specialization.</p> <p>Java takes a code sharing approach, instead of creating a new type for every instantiation, it chooses to erase the type parameters and type arguments during compilation (after type checking, of course).

Java introduces generics only from version 5 onwards.  Prior to version 5, one has to use <code>Object</code> to implement classes that are general enough to work on multiple types, similar to what we did with <code>Pair</code> here:</p> Pair v0.1 (with Object)<pre><code>class Pair {\n  private Object first;\n  private Object second;\n\n  public Pair(Object first, Object second) {\n    this.first = first;\n    this.second = second;\n  }\n\n  public Object getFirst() {\n    return this.first;\n  }\n\n  public Object getSecond() {\n    return this.second;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The Java type erasure process transforms: Pair v0.2 (with Generics)<pre><code>class Pair&lt;S,T&gt; {\n  private S first;\n  private T second;\n\n  public Pair(S first, T second) {\n    this.first = first;\n    this.second = second;\n  }\n\n  public S getFirst() {\n    return this.first;\n  }\n\n  public T getSecond() {\n    return this.second;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>to the version above.  Note that each type parameter <code>S</code> and <code>T</code> are replaced with <code>Object</code>.

The triple <code>.</code> notation is a Java syntax for a variable number of arguments of the same type (<code>T</code>).  Often called varargs, this is just syntactic sugar for passing in an array of items to a method.  The method is called variadic method.  We can then call <code>of</code> with a variable number of arguments, such as:</p> <pre><code>ImmutableSeq&lt;Integer&gt; a;\na = ImmutableSeq.of();\na = ImmutableSeq.of(1, 2, 3);\na = ImmutableSeq.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n</code></pre> <p>We can also call of with a single array as an argument!</p> <pre><code>ImmutableSeq&lt;Integer&gt; a;\na = ImmutableSeq.of(new Integer[] { 1, 2, 3 });\n</code></pre> <p>@SafeVarargs. \u00a0 Since the varargs is just an array, and array and generics do not mix well in Java, the compiler would throw us an unchecked warning.  In this instance, however, we know that our code is safe because we never put anything other than items of type <code>T</code> into the array.  We can use the <code>@SafeVarargs</code> annotation to tell the compiler that we know what we are doing and this varargs is safe.</p> <p>Notice that we removed the <code>set</code> method and there is no other way an external client can modify the array once it is created.  This, of course, assumes that we will only be inserting an immutable object into our immutable array.  Unfortunately, this cannot be enforced by the compiler as the generic type <code>T</code> can be anything.</p> <p>Now, suppose that we wish to support a <code>slice</code> method, that returns a new sequence containing only a range of elements in the original sequence.  It behaves as follows:</p> <pre><code>ImmutableSeq&lt;Integer&gt; a = ImmutableSeq.of(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60);\nImmutableSeq&lt;Integer&gt; b = a.slice(2, 4); // b is [30, 40, 50]\nb.get(0) // returns 30\nImmutableSeq&lt;Integer&gt; c = b.slice(1, 2); // c is [40, 50]\nc.get(1) // returns 50\n</code></pre> <p>A typical way to implement <code>slice</code> is to allocate a new <code>T[]</code> and copy the elements over.  This operation can be expensive if our <code>ImmutableSeq</code> has millions of elements.

The reason is because an array is also a reference type.  The factory method <code>of</code> may accept an array as an input.  Since we are passing this array as an argument to the constructor, the references are all shared and aliased.

In one of many possible designs, the subclasses of <code>Event</code>: <code>ArrivalEvent</code>, <code>DepartureEvent</code>, etc. are not used anywhere outside of <code>BankSimulation</code>.  They can be safely encapsulated within <code>BankSimulation</code> as inner classes, so that these classes can access the fields within the <code>BankSimulation</code> class, simplifying their implementation.</p> <p>A nested class can be either static or non-static.  Just like static fields and static methods, a static nested class is associated with the containing class, NOT an instance.  So, it can only access static fields and static methods of the containing class.  A non-static nested class, on the other hand, can access all fields and methods of the containing class.  A non-static nested class is also known as an inner class.</p> <p>The example below shows a container class <code>A</code> with two nested classes, a non-static inner class <code>B</code>, and a static nested class <code>C</code>.  <code>B</code> can access instance fields, instance methods, class fields, and class methods in <code>A</code>.  <code>C</code> can only access the class fields and class methods in <code>A</code>.</p> <pre><code>class A {\n  private int x;\n  private static int y;\n\n  private class B {\n    void foo() {\n      x = 1; // accessing x from A is OK\n      y = 1; // accessing y from A is OK\n    }\n  }\n\n  private static class C {\n    void bar() {\n      x = 1; // accessing x from A is not OK since C is static\n      y = 1; // accessing y is OK\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Recall that we recommend that all access to instance fields be done through the <code>this</code> reference.  In the example above, however, we can't access <code>this.x</code> from within <code>B</code>.</p> <pre><code>class A {\n private int x;\n\n private class B {\n   void foo() {\n     this.x = 1; // error, but x = 1 is fine!\n   }\n }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Since <code>this.x</code> is called within a method of <code>B</code>, <code>this</code> would refer to the instance of <code>B</code>, rather than the instance of <code>A</code>.  Java has a piece of syntax called qualified <code>this</code> to resolve this.  A qualified <code>this</code> reference is prefixed with the enclosing class name, to differentiate between the <code>this</code> of the inner class and the <code>this</code> of the enclosing class.  In the example above, we can access <code>x</code> from <code>A</code> through the <code>A.this</code> reference.</p> <pre><code>class A {\n  private int x;\n\n  private class B {\n    void foo() {\n      A.this.x = 1; // ok\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"notes/29-nested-classes.html#hiding-nested-classes","title":"Hiding Nested Classes","text":"<p>When we use nested classes for encapsulating the implementation details of the enclosing class, it is better to declare them as <code>private</code> nested classes, so that they are not exposed across the abstract barrier, adhering to the information hiding principle.

In programming, we often need to write functions that take in more than one argument (e.g., <code>add</code> above). Even though <code>Transformer</code> only supports functions with a single parameter, we can build functions that take in multiple arguments.  Let's look at this mathematically first.  Consider a binary function \\(f: (X, Y) \\rightarrow Z\\).  We can introduce \\(F\\) as a set of all functions \\(f': Y \\rightarrow Z\\), and rewrite \\(f\\) as \\(f: X \\rightarrow F\\), or \\(f: X \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\\).</p> <p>The arrow \\(\\rightarrow\\) is to be read from right to left.  So \\(f: X \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\\) is equivalent to \\(f: X \\rightarrow (Y \\rightarrow Z)\\).  But what does it actually mean?  It means that instead of having a function that takes in two arguments, we can instead have a function that takes in one argument (typically the first argument) and returns another function to accept the second argument.</p> <p>A trivial example of this is the <code>add</code> method that adds two <code>int</code> values. <pre><code>int add(int x, int y) {\n  return x + y;\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>This can be written as <pre><code>Transformer&lt;Integer, Transformer&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;&gt; add = x -&gt; y -&gt; (x + y);\n</code></pre></p> <p>To calculate 1 + 1, we call <pre><code>add.transform(1).transform(1);\n</code></pre></p> <p>Let's break it down a little, <code>add</code> is a function that takes in an <code>Integer</code> object and returns a unary <code>Function</code> over <code>Integer</code>.  So <code>add.transform(1)</code> returns the function <code>y -&gt; 1 + y</code>.  We could assign this to a variable: <pre><code>Transformer&lt;Integer,Integer&gt; incr = add.transform(1);\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note that <code>add</code> is no longer a function that takes two arguments and returns a value.  It is a higher-order function that takes in a single argument and returns another function.</p> <p>The technique that translates a general \\(n\\)-ary function to a sequence of \\(n\\) unary functions is called currying.

Consider <code>add(1, 1)</code> \u2014 we have to have both arguments available at the same time to compute the function.  With currying, we no longer have to.  We can evaluate the different arguments at a different time (as the <code>incr</code> example above).  This feature is useful in cases where some arguments are not available until later.  We can partially apply a function first<sup>2</sup>.  This is also useful if one of the arguments does not change often, or is expensive to compute.  We can save the partial results as a function and continue applying it later.

The internal states of the class are heavily protected and hidden.   The implementer selectively provides a set of methods to access and manipulate the internal states of instances.  This approach allows the implementer to control what the client can and cannot do to the internal states.  This is good if we want to build abstractions over specific entities such as shapes or data structures such as a stack, but it is not flexible enough to build general abstraction.</p> <p>Let's consider the following class:</p> Box v0.0.1<pre><code>class Box&lt;T&gt; {\n  private T item;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>It is a box containing a single item of type <code>T</code>.  Suppose that we want to keep the <code>item</code> hidden and we want to have certain rules and maintain some semantics about the use of the <code>item</code>.

What are some ways we can still operate on this <code>item</code>?</p> <p>One way is to clearly define what we can do with the <code>item</code>.  Since the <code>item</code> has a type <code>T</code>, what can be done on <code>item</code> must be whatever can be done on <code>Object</code>.

Let's rename it to <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code>.  <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> is an option type, a common abstraction in programming languages (<code>java.util.Optional</code> in Java, <code>option</code> in Scala, <code>Maybe</code> in Haskell, <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> in C#, etc) that is a wrapper around a value that is either there or is <code>null</code>.  The <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> abstraction allows us to write code without mostly not worrying about the possibility that our value is missing.  When we call <code>map</code> on a value that is missing, nothing happens.</p> <p>Recall that we wish to write a program that is as close to pure mathematical functions as possible, a mathematical function always has a well-defined domain and codomain.  If we have a method that looks like this: <pre><code>Counter c = bank.findCounter();\n</code></pre></p> <p>Then <code>findCounter</code> is mapping from the domain on banks or counters.  However, if we implement <code>findCounter</code> such that it returns <code>null</code> if no counter is available, then <code>findCounter</code> is not a function anymore.  The return value <code>null</code> is not a counter, as we cannot do things that we can normally do on counters to it.  So <code>findCounter</code> now maps to a value outside its codomain!  This violation of the purity of function adds complications to our code, as we now have to specifically filter out <code>null</code> value, and is a common source of bugs.</p> <p>One way to fix this is to have a special counter (say, <code>class NullableCounter extends Counter</code>) that is returned whenever no counter is available.  This way, our <code>findCounter</code> remains a pure function.  But this is not a general solution.  If we adopt this solution, everywhere we return <code>null</code> in place of a non-null instance we have to create a special subclass.</p> <p>Another way, that is more general, is to expand the codomain of the function to include <code>null</code>, and wrap both <code>null</code> and <code>Counter</code> under a type called <code>Maybe&lt;Counter&gt;</code>.  This technique of including new values into the domain is called domain extension.  We make <code>findCounter</code> returns a <code>Maybe&lt;Counter&gt;</code> instead like the following.</p> <pre><code>Maybe&lt;Counter&gt; c = bank.findCounter();\n</code></pre> <p>With this design, <code>findCounter</code> is now a function with the domain <code>Bank</code> mapped to the codomain <code>Maybe&lt;Counter&gt;</code>, and it is pure.</p> <p>Another way to view the <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> class is that it internalizes all the checks for <code>null</code> on the client's behalf.  <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> ensures that if <code>null</code> represents a missing value, then the semantics of this missing value is preserved throughout the chain of <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> operations.  Within its implementation, <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> do the right thing when the value is missing to prevent us from encountering <code>NullPointerException</code>.  There is a check for <code>null</code> when needed, internally, within <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code>.  This internalization removes the burden of checking for <code>null</code> on the programmer and removes the possibility of run-time crashes due to missing <code>null</code> checks.</p>"},{"location":"notes/32-lazy.html","title":"Unit 32: Lazy Evaluation","text":"<p>Learning Objectives</p> <p>After this unit, students should</p> <ul> <li>know what is lazy evaluation and how lambda expression allow us to delay the execution of a computation.</li> <li>understand how memoization and the <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> abstraction allows us to evaluate an expression exactly once.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/32-lazy.html#lambda-as-delayed-data","title":"Lambda as Delayed Data","text":"<p>When we write a lambda expression like this: <pre><code>Transformer&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; f = x -&gt; x + 1;\n</code></pre></p> <p>we are just defining an expression.

We will focus on <code>handle</code> since it is the most general.</p> <p>Suppose we have a computation inside a <code>CompletableFuture&lt;T&gt;</code> that might throw an exception.  Since the computation is asynchronous and could run in a different thread, the question of which thread should catch and handle the exception arises.  <code>CompletableFuture&lt;T&gt;</code> keeps things simpler by storing the exception and passing it down the chain of calls, until <code>join()</code> is called.  <code>join()</code> might throw <code>CompletionException</code> and whoever calls <code>join()</code> will be responsible for handling this exception.  The <code>CompletionException</code> contains information on the original exception.</p> <p>For instance, the code below would throw a <code>CompletionException</code> with a <code>NullPointerException</code> contained within it.</p> <pre><code>CompletableFuture.&lt;Integer&gt;supplyAsync(() -&gt; null)\n                 .thenApply(x -&gt; x + 1)\n                 .join();\n</code></pre> <p>Suppose we want to continue chaining our tasks despite exceptions.  We can use the <code>handle</code> method, to handle the exception.  The <code>handle</code> method takes in a <code>BiFunction</code> (similar to <code>cs2030s.fp.Combiner</code>).  The first parameter of the <code>BiFunction</code> is the value, the second is the exception, and the third is the return value.</p> <p>Only one of the first two parameters is meaningful.  If the exception is not <code>null</code>, this means that an exception has been thrown and we can use the exception (i.e., second parameter).  Otherwise, the exception is <code>null</code> and we can use the value (i.e., first parameter).</p> <p>Here is a simple example where we use <code>handle</code> to replace a default value. <pre><code>cf.thenApply(x -&gt; x + 1)\n  .handle((t, e) -&gt; (e == null) ? t : 0)\n  .join();\n</code></pre></p> <p>Notice how we are checking <code>e == null</code>.

This goal can be achieved by using a thread pool. </p> <p>A thread pool consists of (i) a collection of threads, each waiting for a task to execute, and (ii) a collection of tasks to be executed.

The general idea for the fork-join model is to solve a problem by breaking up the problem into identical problems but with a smaller size (fork), then solve the smaller version of the problem recursively, and then combine the results (join).   This repeats recursively until the problem size is small enough \u2014 we have reached the base case and so we just solve the problem sequentially without further parallelization.</p> <p>In Java, we can create a task that we can fork and join as an instance of the abstract class <code>RecursiveTask&lt;T&gt;</code>.  <code>RecursiveTask&lt;T&gt;</code> supports the methods <code>fork()</code>, which submits a smaller version of the task for execution, and <code>join()</code> (which waits for the smaller tasks to complete and return).   <code>RecursiveTask&lt;T&gt;</code> has an abstract method <code>compute()</code>, which we, as the client, have to define to specify what computation we want to compute.</p> <p>Here is a simple <code>RecursiveTask&lt;T&gt;</code> that recursively sums up the content of an array: <pre><code>class Summer extends RecursiveTask&lt;Integer&gt; {\n  private static final int FORK_THRESHOLD = 2;\n  private int low;\n  private int high;\n  private int[] array;\n\n  public Summer(int low, int high, int[] array) {\n    this.low = low;\n    this.high = high;\n    this.array = array;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  protected Integer compute() {\n    // stop splitting into subtask if array is already small.\n    if (high - low &lt; FORK_THRESHOLD) {\n      int sum = 0;\n      for (int i = low; i &lt; high; i++) {\n        sum += array[i];\n      }\n      return sum;\n    }\n\n    int middle = (low + high) / 2;\n    Summer left = new Summer(low, middle, array);\n    Summer right = new Summer(middle, high, array);\n    left.fork();\n    return right.compute() + left.join();\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>To run this task, we run: <pre><code>Summer task = new Summer(0, array.length, array);\nint sum = task.compute();\n</code></pre></p> <p>The line <code>task.compute()</code> above is just like another method invocation.  It causes the method <code>compute()</code> to be invoked, and if the array is big enough, two new <code>Summer</code> instances, <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>, are created.  <code>left</code>.  We then call <code>left.fork()</code>, which adds the tasks to a thread pool so that one of the threads can call its <code>compute()</code> method.  We subsequently call <code>right.compute()</code> (which is a normal method call).  Finally, we call <code>left.join()</code>, which blocks until the computation of the recursive sum is completed and returned.  We add the result from <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> together and return the sum.</p> <p>There are other ways we can combine and order the execution of <code>fork()</code>, <code>compute()</code>, and <code>join()</code>.

The details are beyond the scope of this course, but it would be interesting to note a few key points, as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Each thread has a deque<sup>1</sup> of tasks.  </li> <li>When a thread is idle, it checks its deque of tasks.  If the deque is not empty, it picks up a task at the head of the deque to execute (e.g., invoke its <code>compute()</code> method).  Otherwise, if the deque is empty, it picks up a task from the tail of the deque of another thread to run.  The latter is a mechanism called work stealing.</li> <li>When <code>fork()</code> is called, the caller adds itself to the head of the deque of the executing thread.  The method returns immediately and execution continues.  This may cause another <code>fork()</code> to be executed which adds another task into the head of the deque.  This is done so that the most recently forked task gets executed next, similar to how normal recursive calls.</li> <li>When <code>join()</code> is called, several cases might happen.  If the subtask to be joined hasn't been executed, its <code>compute()</code> method is called and the subtask is executed.  If the subtask to be joined has been completed (some other thread has stolen this and completed it), then the result is read, and <code>join()</code> returns.  If the subtask to be joined has been stolen and is being executed by another thread, then the current thread either finds some other tasks to work on from its local deque, or steals another task from another deque.</li> </ul> <p>The beauty of the mechanism here is that the threads always look for something to do and they cooperate to get as much work done as possible.</p> <p>The mechanism here is similar to that implemented in .NET and Rust.</p>"},{"location":"notes/40-forkjoin.html#order-of-fork-and-join","title":"Order of <code>fork()</code> and <code>join()</code>","text":"<p>One implication of how <code>ForkJoinPool</code> adds and removes tasks from the deque is the order in which we call <code>fork()</code> and <code>join()</code>.

In other words, the order of forking should be the reverse of the order of joining.</p> <p>In the class <code>Summer</code> above, <pre><code>    left.fork();  // &gt;-----------+\n    right.fork(); // &gt;--------+  | should have\n    return right.join() // &lt;--+  | no crossing\n         + left.join(); // &lt;-----+\n</code></pre></p> <p>is more efficient than <pre><code>    left.fork();  // &gt;-------------+\n    right.fork(); // &gt;----------+  | there is crossing\n    return left.join()   // &lt;---|--+\n         + right.join(); // &lt;---+\n</code></pre></p> <p>In other words, your <code>fork()</code>, <code>compute()</code>, <code>join()</code> order should form a palindrome and there should be no crossing.

These small programs each do one thing only (and do it well) and so are easier to write and less prone to bugs.</p> <p>The composition of these utility programs relies on two things.  First, plain text is often used as input and output of the programs.  These allow the programs to understand each other easily.  Second, they use <code>|</code> to communicate with each other.  The <code>|</code> operator takes the standard output from one program and redirects it as the standard input of another program.</p> <p>For instance, <pre><code>$ cat test.txt | wc\n       1      11      64\n</code></pre> compose <code>cat</code> and <code>wc</code> together.
