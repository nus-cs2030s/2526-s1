# Unit 12: Overriding

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"

    After this unit, students should

    - be aware that every class inherits from `Object`.
    - be familiar with the `equals` and `toString` methods.
    - understand what constitutes a method signature.
    - understand method overriding.
    - appreciate the power of method overriding.
    - understand what Java annotations are for, and know when to use `@Override`.
    - be exposed to the `String` class and its associated methods, especially the `+` operator.

## `Object` and `String`

In Java, every class that does not extend another class inherits from the [class `Object`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html) implicitly.  `Object` is, therefore, the "ancestor" of all classes in Java and is at the root of the class hierarchy.

The `Object` class does not encapsulate anything in particular.  It is a very general class that provides useful methods common to all objects.  The two useful ones that we are going to spend time with are:

- `equals(Object obj)`, which checks if two objects are equal to each other, and
- `toString()`, which returns a string representation of the object as a `String` object.

Now that we have related classes as well as methods that may be inherited, we will introduce a notation that captures the essence of a method as well as where the method is _implemented_.  Consider the method `equals(Object obj)` in the class `Object`.  First, note that the parameter name `obj` can be renamed, so the name does not matter.  As such, we can omit them.  Secondly, we need to indicate that the implementation we are interested in is the implementation in the class `Object`.  So, we can write it simply as `Object::equals(Object)`.

## The `toString` Method

The `toString` method is very special, as this is invoked _implicitly_ by Java, by default, to convert a reference object to a `String` object during string concatenation using the operator `+`.

[We showed you](02-type.md) that in Python, `4 + "Hello"` would result in a type mismatch error.  In Java, however, `4 + "Hello"` will result in the string `"4Hello"`.  In this example, the primitive value 4 is converted to a string before concatenation.

A more interesting scenario is what happens if we try to concatenate, say, a `Circle` object with a string.  Let's say we have:

```Java
Circle c = new Circle(new Point(0, 0), 4.0);
String s = "Circle c is " + c;
```

You will see that `s` now contains the string "Circle c is Circle@1ce92674 " (the seemingly gibberish text after @ is the reference to the object so your result will be different).

What happened here is that the `+` operator sees that one of the operands is a string but the other is not, so it converts the one that is not a string to a string by calling its `toString()` method automatically for us.  This is equivalent to[^1]
```Java
Circle c = new Circle(new Point(0, 0), 4.0);
String s = "Circle c is " + c.toString();
```

[^1]: Calling `toString` explicitly is not wrong, but we usually omit the call to keep the code readable and succinct.

Recall that in our `Circle` class (up to version 0.5) we do not have any `Circle::toString()` method.  The `toString` method that we invoked here is the `toString` method inherited from its parent `Object` (_i.e.,_ `Object::toString()`).

!!! Note "`jshell` and `toString`"
    Recall that `jshell` is a REPL tool.  After evaluating an expression, `jshell` prints the resulting value.  If the resulting value is a reference type, `jshell` will invoke `toString` to convert the reference type to a string first, before printing the string.

## Customizing `toString` for `Circle`

The `Object::toString()` method is not very user-friendly.  Ideally, when we print a `Circle` object, say, for debugging, we want to see its center and its radius.  To do so, we can define our own `toString` method in `Circle`  (_i.e.,_ `Circle::toString()`).  Let's upgrade our `Circle` class to do this:

```Java hl_lines="34-40" title="Circle v0.6 (with toString)"
import java.lang.Math;

/**
 * A Circle object encapsulates a circle on a 2D plane.  
 */
class Circle {
  private Point c;   // the center
  private double r;  // the length of the radius

  /**
   * Create a circle centered on Point c with given radius r
   */
  public Circle(Point c, double r) {
    this.c = c;
    this.r = r;
  }

  /**
   * Return the area of the circle.
   */
  public double getArea() {
    return Math.PI * this.r * this.r;
  }

  /**
   * Return true if the given point p is within the circle.
   */
  public boolean contains(Point p) {
    return false;
    // TODO: Left as an exercise
  }

  /**
   * Return the string representation of this circle.
   */
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "{ center: " + this.c + ", radius: " + this.r + " }";
  }
}
```

The body of the method `Circle::toString()` simply constructs a string representation for this circle object and returns it.  With this `toString` implemented, the output will look something like this:
```
Circle c is { center: (0.0, 0.0), radius: 4.0 }
```

Note that when the center `this.c` is converted to a string, the `toString` method of the `Point` class is invoked (_i.e.,_ `Point::toString()`).  We leave the implementation of `Point::toString()` as an exercise.

## Method Signature and Descriptor

Let's define the _method signature_ of a method as the method name and the number of parameters, the type of each parameter, and the order of its parameters.  We define the _method descriptor_ as the method signature plus the return type.

The notions of method signature and descriptor are important ones for the compilers, as they are what the compiler uses to uniquely identify a method.  

Suppose we have the following class,

```Java
class C {
  A foo(B1 x, B2 y) {
  }
}
```

Using our notation, we denote the method signature for `foo` in `C` as `C::foo(B1, B2)`.  The method descriptor for the same implementation is `A C::foo(B1, B2)`.   

We may exclude the class names when we want to talk about the method regardless of where it is implemented.  Lastly, we may omit the parameters if we want to talk about all the methods with the given name (e.g., `A::foo` or `foo`).

## Method Overriding

Coming back to our `Circle` v0.6.  What we just did when we defined `Circle::toString(`)` is called _method overriding_ in OOP.  Inheritance is not only good for extending the behavior of an existing class but through method overriding, we can _alter_ the behavior of an existing class as well.

When a subclass defines an instance method with the same _method descriptor_ as an instance method in the parent class, we say that the instance method in the subclass _overrides_ the instance method in the parent class[^2].  In the example above, `Circle::toString` has overridden `Object::toString`.

[^2]: It is possible to override a method in some cases when the return type is different.  We will discuss this during recitations.

## The `@Override` Annotation

Line 37 in the `Circle` example above contains the symbol `@Override`.  This symbol is an example of _annotation_ in Java.  An annotation is not part of the program and does not affect the bytecode generated.  Instead, it is a _hint_ to the compiler.  Remember that the compiler is our friend who will do its best to help detect errors early, during compilation.  We must do our part to help the compiler help us.

Here, `@Override` is a hint to the compiler that the following method, `toString`, is intended to override the method in the parent class.  If the compiler detects that the overridden method does not exist in the superclass (e.g., due to typo, etc), then the compiler will generate an error.

It is therefore recommended and expected that all overriding methods in your code are annotated with `@Override`.

!!! note "Using `super` To Access Overridden Methods"
    After a subclass overrides a method in the superclass, the methods that have been overridden can still be called, with the `super` keyword.
    For instance, the following `Circle::toString` calls `Object::toString` to prefix the string representation of the circle with `Circle@1ce92674`.
    ```Java
    @Override
    public String toString() {
	      return super.toString() + " { center: " + this.c + ", radius: " + this.r + " }";
    }
    ```
