# Week 01: Class and Compilation

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- [**Overview**](../00-overview.md)

    After this unit, students should
    
    - understand the aims of CS2030/S.
    - understand how the key concepts covered in CS2030/S are related to each other.

- [**Program and Compiler**](../01-compiler.md)

    After this unit, students should
    
    - recap some fundamental programming concepts, including the concept of a program, a programming language, a compiler, and an interpreter.
    - be aware of two modes of running a Java program (compiled vs. interpreted).
    - be aware that compile-time errors are better than run-time errors, but the compiler cannot always detect errors during compile time.
    
- [**Variable and Type**](../02-type.md)

    After this unit, students should
    
    - appreciate the concept of variables as an abstraction.
    - understand the concept of types and subtypes.
    - contrast between statically typed language vs. dynamically typed language.
    - contrast between strongly typed language vs. weakly typed language.
    - be familiar with Java variables and primitive types.
    - understand widening type conversion in the context of variable assignments and how subtyping dictates whether the type conversion is allowed.

- [**Functions**](../03-function.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - understand the importance of function as a programming construct and how it helps to reduce complexity and mitigate bugs.
    - be aware of two different roles a programmer can play: the implementer and the client.
    - understand the concept of abstraction barrier as a wall between the client and the implementer, including in the context of a function.

- [**Encapsulation**](../04-encapsulation.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - understand composite data type as an even higher level abstraction over variables.
    - understand encapsulation as an object-oriented (OO) principle.
    - understand the meaning of class, object, fields, and methods, in the context of OO programming.
    - be able to define a class and instantiate one as an object in Java.
    - appreciate OO as a natural way to model the real world in programs.
    - understand reference types in Java and their differences from the primitive types.
