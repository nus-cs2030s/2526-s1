# Week 03: Polymorphism

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- [**Overloading**](../13-overloading.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - understand what is overloading.
    - understand how to create overloaded methods.

- [**Polymorphism**](../14-polymorphism.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - understand polymorphism.
    - be aware of dynamic binding.
    - be aware of the `equals` method and the need to override it to customize the equality test.
    - understand when narrowing type conversion and type casting are allowed.

- [**Method Invocation**](../15-dynamic-binding.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - understand the two-step process that Java uses to determine which method implementation will be executed when a method is invoked.
    - understand that Class Methods do not support dynamic binding.

- [**Liskov Substitution Principle**](../16-lsp.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - understand the type of bugs that reckless developers can introduce when using inheritance and polymorphism.
    - understand the Liskov Substitution Principle and thus be aware that not all IS-A relationships should be modeled with inheritance.
    - know how to explicitly disallow inheritance (for a class) or disallow overriding (for a method) with the `final` keyword.

- [**Abstract Class**](../17-abstract.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - be familiar with the concept of an abstract class.
    - know the use of the Java keyword `abstract` and the constraints that come with it.
    - understand the usefulness of defining and using an abstract class.
    - understand what makes a class concrete.

- [**Interface**](../18-interface.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - understand interface as a type for modeling "can do" behavior.
    - understand the subtype-supertype relationship between a class and its interfaces.
