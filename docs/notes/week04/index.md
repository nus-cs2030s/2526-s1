<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- [**Wrapper Class**](../19-wrapper.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - be aware that Java provides wrapper classes around the primitive types.
    - be aware that Java will transparently and automatically box and unbox between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes.

- [**Runtime Class Mismatch**](../20-casting.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - understand the need for narrowing type conversion and typecasting when writing code that depends on higher-level abstraction.
    - understand the possibility of encountering run-time errors if typecasting is not done properly.

- [**Variance**](../21-variance.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - understand the definition of the variance of types: covariant, contravariant, and invariant.
    - be aware that the Java array is covariant and how it could lead to run-time errors that cannot be caught during compile time.

- [**Exceptions**](../22-exception.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - understand the handling of Java exceptions and how to use the `try`-`catch`-`finally` blocks.
    - understand the hierarchy of exception classes and the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.
    - be able to create new types of exceptions.
    - understand the control flow of exceptions.
    - be aware of good practices for exception handling.
