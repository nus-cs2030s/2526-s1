# Week 05: Generics

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- [**Generics**](../23-generics.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - know how to define and instantiate a generic type and a generic method.
    - be familiar with the term parameterized types, type arguments, type parameters.
    - appreciate how generics can reduce duplication of code and improve type safety.

- [**Type Erasure**](../24-erasure.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - understand that generics are implemented with type erasure in Java.
    - understand that type information is not fully available during run-time when generics are used, and problems that this could cause.
    - be aware that arrays and generics don't mix well in Java.
    - know the terms reifiable type and heap pollution.

- [**Unchecked Warnings**](../25-unchecked.md)

    After this unit, students should

    - be aware of how to use generics with an array.
    - be aware of unchecked warnings that compilers can give when we are using generics.
    - be able to make arguments as to why a piece of code is type-safe for simple cases.
    - know how to suppress warnings from compilers.
    - be aware of the ethics when using the @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") annotation.
    - know what is a raw type.
    - be aware that raw types should never never be used in modern Java.
